# 🤖 NodeMesh — AI-Powered Intent-Based Assistant

NodeMesh is a responsive AI assistant built using **React + Vite** on the frontend and a modular **Node.js/Express.js backend**. It intelligently routes user queries based on intent—leveraging **Gemini Flash 2.0**, **WeatherAPI**, and **NewsAPI** to deliver accurate, real-time responses.


## 🚀 Features

- **Sarcasm, Intent-Based Query Handling**  
  Automatically detects user intent or sarcasm across:
  - `general`/`sarcasm` → Gemini Flash 2.0
  - `weather`, `rain`, `alert` → WeatherMap API
  - `news` → NewsAPI

- **Smart Prompt Engineering**  
  Each API is guided by tailored prompts to ensure clarity, relevance, and structured output. Gemini is used for summarization, reasoning, and fallback logic.
  This handles the sarcasm of the user and answers it rather than assuming it literally. Apart from this, we have incorporated Gita Shlokas to answer distressed and mentally tired queries(used few-shot learning)

- **Frontend**  
  - Built with **React + Vite**
  - Responsive UI with **Dark/Light Mode toggle**
  - Clean routing and modular component design

- **Backend**  
  - Runs via `npm run server`
  - Handles API orchestration and intent parsing
  - Secured with `.env` for API key management

## 🧠 Powered by Gemini Flash 2.0

Gemini Flash 2.0 is used to:
- Handle general queries with natural language understanding
- Summarize external API responses
- Format answers using markdown, bullet points, or JSON when needed

Prompt engineering is reflected in how each query is structured and routed, ensuring high-quality, context-aware responses.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
